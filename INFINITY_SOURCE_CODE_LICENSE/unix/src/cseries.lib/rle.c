first long word is raw size
run count 0�n<128 repeat n+3 of next byte
        128�n�255 n-127 bytes of raw data follows

	fix to compress_bytes().
Monday, November 9, 1992 3:01:45 PM
	moved into cseries.lib, retrofitting a minotaur fix to uncompress bytes.  remember
	we still have that lurking problem where the size of the data before compression is
	sometimes not equal to the size of the data after compression and decompression.
Thursday, January 21, 1993 9:52:03 AM
	changed two �raw_size>=0� expressions to �raw_size>0� in compress_bytes, in an attempt to
	fix the above problem.  i doubt this is it.

	the read pointer in compress bytes wasn�t getting incremented while scanning non-repeating
	data.  who the fuck did that and have they gotten the tree out of their ass yet?  and what
	the hell, the raw_count was not being reset after we�d scanned 127 (or whatever) bytes of
	uncompressable data.  blow me.  is it possible that minotaur�s shapes never contained
	that much uncompressable data?

	this is a fucking comedy, right?  we were allowing repeats of 131 bytes, which encoded
	to [128] [byte] and only dropped one.  deja vu: �is it possible that minotaur�s shapes
	never contained that much COMPRESSABLE data?�  what a piece of shit.  that delayed me
	three hours.
